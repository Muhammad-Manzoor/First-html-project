                <p>
                    Plastic pollution is one of the most pressing environmental issues of our 
                    time. Every year, millions of tons of plastic waste end up in our oceans, 
                    harming marine life and ecosystems. Plastic takes hundreds of years to 
                    decompose, and during this time, it breaks down into microplastics that
                    contaminate our food and water.

                        At Plastik, we advocate for the use of sustainable alternatives 
                        to plastic. Here are some simple yet effective ways to reduce plastic 
                        use in your daily life:
